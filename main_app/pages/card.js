              Each voter may rank the different choices in any order. Votes are
              initially counted for each voter's number one choice. If a
              candidate has more than half of the vote based on number one
              choices, that choice wins. If not, then the choice with the fewest
              number one votes is eliminated. Voters who had chosen the defeated
              choice as number one now have their number two choice counted as
              number one choice. The process continues over multiple rounds
              until a choice has more than half the votes.
